To solve this problem I have created two version so we can compare which one is more efficient.

In one hand the total Big O is O(n + m) which is means that
has a linear dependency in the length of the message and the numbers of letters in the bowl.
In other hand the total Big O for the second version is O(n*m) so it has a cuadratic dependency. In consequence this
function is slower when the length of the strings are big.

Taking in consideration the Big O analysis we can confirm that the first version is most efficient than the second
version.
